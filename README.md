## Technical overview
**Frontend**: React is used to build a frontend part of the store. The application is a SPA: appropiate screens are loaded from App.js. The app takes advantage of Redux for updating states of components. According to Redux pattern I set up a store, which is a kind of client-side database. When there is an event on a website, an action is dispatched to a reducer and that reducer updates the store. That cycle handles states of components of the app.

**Backend**: Backend part is mainly located in Django app called 'base'. Frontend and backend are communicating with each other using REST APIs (Django REST Framework comes here in handy). Web requests from frontend are handled by view functions which return web respones back to frontend. The urls files assign URLs to appropriate views. Postgres is used for database management. Connection with database is realized by using models.py file, where models are defined. Every model is a class. Every class is a database table. Attributes in those classes are database table columns.

## The project status
The development of the project is finished. The project will be soon deployed to a live server.
